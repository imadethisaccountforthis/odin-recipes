    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>2 ground beef patties (4 ounces each)</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 and a half cups beef stock</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 drops sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>

<li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne; set aside.</li>

<li>Whisk together beef stock, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, cornstarch, ketchup, sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl; set aside.</li>        

<li>Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Flip patties; add green onions and cook until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove patties and most of green onions to a plate.</li>

<li>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.</li>

<li>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.</li>

<li>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over rice, spoon gravy on top, and add fried eggs.</li>

<li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
